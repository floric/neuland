This is my first real Rust test. I decided to create a simple graph library / in-memory database.

Please feel free to propose code improvements. This is a pure learning project for Rust and graph theory. :)

## Instructions

To format and build the project and run its tests, simply use `cargo make`.

## Resources

Airplane data under `/tests/resources/airplanes.graphml` is generated by [Kelvin R. Lawrence](https://github.com/krlawrence/graph).
